do you remember standing on the broken fields
while crippled wings beating the sky
the harbingers of the war with their nature revialed 
and our chances flowing by...

if I can let the memory healed 
I will remember you with me on that field

when I thought that I fought this war alone
you were there, by my side on the frontline
when I though that I fought without a cause
you gave me a reason to try
